# OLYMPICS DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL 

## Instead of using Excel directly using the SQL Queries to retrive all the information that are related to it. 

## I have used the MySQL Workbench for this SQL Project for pulling information from the database. Initially created a table in the database and loaded the file into the database then retrived the information using the queries.
 
## Used different queries for retriving different informations from the database. I have attached the queries in the repository for the refernce you can check that for better understanding.
